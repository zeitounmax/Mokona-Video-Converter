## What is Mokona Video Converter ?

The Mokona Video Converter is a small script that uses dependencies and FFMPEG.

## How to Install :

You need FFMPEG on your computer, whether you're running Windows or Linux (Linux preferred).

`Git clone git@github.com:zeitounmax/Mokona-Video-Converter.git ` for download the project .

`npm i ` to install dependencies

and ` node mvc.js` for launch the script.

## How to use :

Take the video you want to encode and embed it in the project folder. After launching the js script, it will detect the video you want to encode in the folder and then follow the on-screen instructions.

## Why this js file for encoding?

I created it to practice a little, learn new tricks and also to think of an idea that came to me. It's a "GarbageCode", a code that's good for the trash. Whether it works or not (it does here), it's just a way of testing an idea that works.
